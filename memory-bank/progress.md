## Current Status

The application is in an early development stage with basic functionality implemented. Users can search for movies and TV series and view basic information about them. The UI structure is in place, but many features are still pending implementation.

### Development Progress

- **Search Functionality**: 90% complete
- **UI Components**: 70% complete
- **Bookmarking**: 10% complete (UI only)
- **Navigation**: 40% complete (structure only, no routing)
- **Responsive Design**: 50% complete
- **Error Handling**: 60% complete

## Known Issues

1. **Search Limitations**: The search only works with the OMDB API's search endpoint, which has limitations on result count and pagination.

   - **Status**: To be addressed
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Bookmark Button**: The bookmark button is currently non-functional, only showing the UI.

   - **Status**: To be implemented
   - **Priority**: High

3. **Navigation**: Navigation items don't have active states and don't actually navigate to different views.

   - **Status**: To be implemented
   - **Priority**: High

4. **Modal Integration**: The modal component exists but is not properly integrated with movie details.

   - **Status**: To be implemented
   - **Priority**: Medium

5. **API Key Exposure**: The API key is currently stored directly in the App.js file, which is not secure for production.

   - **Status**: To be addressed
   - **Priority**: High for production, Low for development

6. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is in place, but more specific error messages and recovery options are needed.
   - **Status**: Partially implemented
   - **Priority**: Medium

## Next Milestone Goals

1. Implement routing between different sections
2. Complete the bookmarking functionality with local storage
3. Enhance the modal to display detailed movie information
4. Add filtering by content type (Movies vs. TV Series)
5. Improve responsive design for mobile devices
