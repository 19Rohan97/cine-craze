# Active Context: Cine-Craze

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing the core functionality of the Cine-Craze application. The application has a basic structure in place with the following components:

- Header with navigation
- Search functionality
- Movie listing with basic information
- Placeholder for bookmarking functionality
- Modal component for detailed views

The application currently fetches movie data from the OMDB API based on a search query and displays the results in a grid layout.

## Recent Changes

- Set up the basic project structure with React and Tailwind CSS
- Implemented the main layout with a fixed sidebar navigation
- Created components for displaying movie information
- Integrated the OMDB API for fetching movie data
- Implemented search functionality
- Added loading and error states

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Navigation Implementation

- The navigation structure is in place, but the actual routing between different sections (Home, Movies, TV Series, Bookmarked) is not yet implemented.
- Decision needed: Whether to use React Router for navigation or implement a custom state-based solution.

### Bookmarking Functionality

- The UI for bookmarking is in place (bookmark icon), but the actual functionality to save and retrieve bookmarks is not implemented.
- Decision needed: How to persist bookmarks (local storage, backend service, etc.).

### Modal Implementation

- A modal component exists but is not fully integrated with the movie details.
- Decision needed: What additional information to display in the modal and how to fetch it.

### API Integration

- Currently using basic search functionality from OMDB API.
- Decision needed: Whether to implement additional API endpoints for more detailed information.

## Next Steps

### High Priority

1. Implement routing to navigate between different sections
2. Complete the bookmarking functionality
3. Enhance the modal to display detailed movie information
4. Implement filtering by content type (Movies vs. TV Series)

### Medium Priority

1. Add pagination for search results
2. Implement responsive design improvements for mobile devices
3. Add sorting options for movie listings
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback

### Low Priority

1. Add user authentication for personalized bookmarks
2. Implement advanced search filters
3. Add ratings and reviews functionality
4. Optimize performance for large result sets

## Current Challenges

1. **Bookmarking Persistence**: Determining the best approach for storing and retrieving bookmarked items.
2. **Navigation State**: Managing the active state of navigation items without a router.
3. **API Limitations**: Working within the constraints of the OMDB API (rate limits, data structure).
4. **Modal Integration**: Connecting the modal to display detailed information for the selected movie.

## Recent Insights

1. The OMDB API provides basic information in search results, but detailed information requires additional API calls.
2. The current component structure works well for the basic functionality but may need refactoring as features are added.
3. Tailwind CSS provides a good foundation for styling, but custom components may be needed for more complex UI elements.
4. The current state management approach (prop drilling) may become unwieldy as the application grows.
